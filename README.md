# Competition in communities

This repository has R files for the simulation of differential equations for 

1. Competition
1. Predator-prey

These files are just the base. They are meant for reference as to the basic layout
for a two-dimensional system. Also there is a n-dimensional system, done in
matrix notation, so it is flexible as to the number of dimensions. This means
that only one file is enough for simulating any number of dimensions.
